    "On the job, I'm often asked to setup a measurement plan for a new app feature or quantify something that's happend in the past. There's several common calculations for metrics including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sum: result of adding numbers\n",
    "- Count: total number of occurences of something\n",
    "- Average: a number to regard the central tendancy of a set of values calculated as the sum of a condition divided by the count of occurences of that condition\n",
    "- Percentile: a value that represents a threshold for the percentage of data points less than the value\n",
    "- Ratio: comparison of two numbers into a value\n",
    "- Probability: how likely something is to happen\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'll walk through a scenario in which I am asked to calculate the *success* of a website homepage that's for a note-taking app. *Success* is a vague word and there's lots of ways we can characterize it. With each metric using a calculation from the list above, I'll align that metric to be relevant to overall business goal: get as many weekly active users as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The homepage is just meant to educate people about the note-taking app and encourage them to sign up. There's a lot of content on the homepage about the features of the app and there's a single signup button to create an account and use the note-taking app. \n",
    "\n",
    "A caveat: this is a very simple business example and this post is meant to introduce popular summary business metrics. For a real-world project, I'd encourage you to understand your business problems, business goals and the pros and cons of each potential metric you choose. Here's a <a href=\"https://firstround.com/review/im-sorry-but-those-are-vanity-metrics/\" target=\"_blank\">great article</a> from First Round Capital that goes into more detail on evaluation of types of metrics on whether they're a practical indicator of your business' success."
