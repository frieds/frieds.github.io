    "- Twilio to send and receive txt messages. In the past, Uber used Twilio's API so they could send you a txt message to alert you that your driver was nearby.\n",
    "- Weather Underground to retrieve weather data. If you use a mobile app to view the weather today, that app is likely using an API from Weather Underground or a similar company to retrive Weather Underground's proprietary weather data they collect.\n",
