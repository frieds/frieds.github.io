    "Initially, we may apply a treatment to a sample and compare how a parameter of that sample differs from the same parameter from the popoulation without the treatment. However, it's possible to have **sampling error**. This is likely since we're unsure of the characteristics of the observations in the sample and they may not be representative of the whole population. We're unable to measure the exact sampling error since the ture population with the treatment is unkown at the beginning of a statistical hypothesis test. \n",
