    "### Logic for Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "I will have to examine every element in the input string. Therefore, I should iterate over it. A string is a Python sequence that allows for iteration over every element.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I think about the input `\"[{]}\"`, I know that every successive open bracket must be closed by the same type *before* an earlier open bracket is closed. Let me write out a few step-by-step examples on how I'd solve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "One data structure that comes to mind here is a stack. A stack stores elements in what seems like a list, but it is optimized by time complexity for operations by last-in-first-out - aka \"LIFO\" - and first-in-first-out - aka \"FIFO\". \n",
    "\n",
    "A stack optimized data structure in Python is found in the `collections` package and `deque` module. For a `deque`, use the `append` method to insert an element into the end of the structure and `pop` to remove an element from the end of the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations for `\"[{]}\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Iterate over element `\"[\"`. Since it's an open bracket, append to deque b/c open bracket.\n",
    "2. Iterate over `\"{\"`. Since it's an open bracket, append to deque b/c open bracket.\n",
    "3. Iterate over `\"]\"`. Since it's a closed bracket, compare this to the last item in the deque. This element is a different type than the last item in the deque. Therefore, return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operation for `\"[[{}]]\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Iterate over element `\"[\"`. Since it's an open bracket, append to deque b/c open bracket.\n",
    "2. Iterate over element `\"[\"`. Since it's an open bracket, append to deque b/c open bracket.\n",
    "3. Iterate over element `\"{\"`. Since it's an open bracket, append to deque b/c open bracket.\n",
    "4. Iterate over element `\"}\"`. Since it's a closed bracket, compare this to the last item in the deque. This is element is the same type as the last item in the deque. Pop out last item added to deque.\n",
    "5. Iterate over element `\"]]\"`. Since it's a closed bracket, compare this to the last item in the deque. This is element is the same type as the last item in the deque. Pop out last item added to deque.\n",
    "6. Iterate over element `\"]\"`. Since it's a closed bracket, compare this to the last item in the deque. This is element is the same type as the last item in the deque. Pop out last item added to deque.\n",
    "7. Return True\n",
