# About This Site & Me

### Site Details

Hi! I built this site to clearly document important concepts learned in data, programming and career advice.

There's lots of real-world examples, digestible small code snippets and plentiful visualizations to make learning (hopefully) fun and easy! Enjoy!

Much of my content is very old - even 5+ years stale. So it's not always representative of my current knowledge or should be a single source of truth on a topic.

### About Me

I'm an experienced software engineer with a focus on backend and data applications. Previously, I spent a few years as a Data Scientist, mostly doing ETL and analytics.

My technical skills: Python, serverless patterns, Serverless Framework, AWS Lambda, SQS, Postgres, DynamoDB, SQL, REST APIs, Snowflake, dbt and observability with Datadog and PagerDuty.

Things I built recently for fun:

- CLI card game of War. I wanted to practice more OOP, use Enums and design a game. [Github repo](https://github.com/frieds/card_game_war)

- Automate creation of sunrise and sunset calendar events, and build a one-click iOS app (through Apple Shortcuts) to recommend what clothes to wear based on the weather. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/frieds/hello_day)
