    "### Goals of the Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn careers in data visualization\n",
    "- Learn how data visualization is used to tell stories - often better than what can be told through words through topics:\n",
    "    - Dashboards in industry\n",
    "    - Data viz in news\n",
    "    - Storytelling through data visualization \n",
    "    - Hard math through data viz\n",
    "- Build a portfolio of 2 significant projects hosted on GitHub (and maybe your personal website) to highlight your skills and passions.\n",
    "    - That’s your credibility of data visualization skills\n",
    "- Make friends with your peers & collaborate with others on idea generation, data analysis, data visualizations, and presentations.\n",
    "- Have fun! "

    "### How and Why This Course is Different Than Other Courses\n",
    "\n",
    "- The previous class had lots of lab exercises with mandated visualizations to create and datasets to work off of. It seemed like a lot of context switching between types of visualizations, stories and datasets. This time around, there’s no lab assignments. I think the class will be more fun and enriching for you to spend more time on data you find interesting.\n",
    "- Most classes involve lots of lectures. You often sit idly for 1 hour or more every class. However, what if there’s something you don’t understand in that lecture? Or you want to stop and stare at something? Or google a concept? It’s often tough to learn at the same pace as your peers. It’s something I struggled with in every class. I want students to learn at their own pace. Instead of long lectures, we’ll have short ones - often just 15 - 30 min which I’ll expect more discussion from the audience. There’s fabulous content online and I’ll direct you to great content for your learning interests. \n",
    "- In school, I rarely chatted with professors 1-on-1 and got individual attention. I want to help all of you succeed at what interests you in the realm of data visualizations. Let’s do that together! I’ll likely be able to meet with all of you 1 on 1 at least every other class or through office hours online. I can provide feedback on your project ideas, code, visualizations and online portfolio for showcasing your work.\n",
    "- In most classes, you rarely leave with something to show potential employers. Most times there’s simply exams and homework assignments. This class is different. My goal is to help everyone build a portfolio of data investigation and visualization work they’re proud of! That’s not something you’ll get online in a MOOC, sitting at home trying to learn on your own or reading a book. With this class, you’ll get constant feedback from your peers and myself to build an excellent portfolio.  \n",
    "- With most classes, students cram last minute to get it done. The panic monster sits in a couple days before the deadline...that won’t happen here. You’ll be expected to show progress each week to me 1-on-1 and through your GitHub activity. Don’t let the <a href='https://youtu.be/arj7oStGLkU' rel=\"nofollow\">panic monster</a> out! \n",
    "- Most teams settle on a project idea and run with it, whether it works out or not. In investigating data sources, that isn’t usually the case. You’ll likely uncover the data is messy, insufficient for the visualizations you have in mind, or maybe isn’t interesting to you anymore. Don’t worry. There’s ample time for you to change ideas. I want you to complete only something you’re proud of.\n",
    "- Some classes cover pros and cons of lots of technologies. This class isn’t as much on the technical details of a technology - rather, can you use but one or two technologies to tell a good story through visualizations? I’d rather you leave a master of one technology and making visualizations in general than a jack of all trades. \n",
    "- Great data visualizations are often subjective; there’s no clear cut answer. In fact, I could provide a million tips on how to make great visualizations. Therefore, you’ll need a lot more feedback from your peers and the instructor to fine tune your designs and ensure they’re easy to understand, aesthetically pleasing and relevant for your message. "

    "- **Technical:**\n",
    "    - Fair: Visualizations and/or code may be difficult to understand in certain sections. Mediocre storytelling through visualizations. \n",
    "    - Good: Uses mainly slightly modified off-the-shelf examples. May focus on simple visualizations with simple bar, pie, line, etc. Visualizations incorporate some benchmarking or comparison efforts.\n",
    "    - Excellent: 3 or more significant and interesting visualizations presented. Utilized advanced features of viz library. New viz type shown above simple bar/pie/line chart. May utilize strong stats/math. Possibly incorporates new dataset for additional insights. Visualizations incorporate benchmarking or comparison efforts. Appropriate visualizations chosen that help emphasize key takeaways.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Presentation:**\n",
    "    - Fair: Recites simply what’s on slides. May be hard to follow logic, speaks at great lengths without making a point, or dry. Visualizations difficult to understand in limited presentation time.\n",
    "    - Good: Presents interesting content but communications similar to norm of people studied/worked with previously. Visualization has parts difficult to read.\n",
    "    - Excellent: Expresses ideas clearly; engages/captivates audience. Visualizations are easy to read and annotated if needed to highlight key points. Would be really excited to see this person present again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documentation:**\n",
    "    - Fair: Work published online, but minimal details or difficult to understand. Or perhaps work not public on GitHub at all. Minimal or weak interpretations of visualizations. Possibly no table of contents included.\n",
    "    - Good: Work online but perhaps at times wordy or difficult to understand flow. Good interpretations of visualizations.\n",
    "    - Excellent: Code, visualizations and text storyline documented in detail on GitHub. Great interpretation of visualizations. Table of contents included in Notebook. Significant effort in detail and would be worthy of citing in an established online publication. Bonus points if published through an additional website or blog post.\n"

Still, I'm of the opinion that we cannot ignore Matplotlib's strength as a well-tested, cross-platform graphics engine.\" - via <a href='https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.00-introduction-to-matplotlib.html' rel='nofollow'>Python Data Science Handbook</a>\n",
